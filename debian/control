Description: HDF5-UDF is a mechanism to dynamically generate HDF5 datasets through user-defined functions (UDFs) written in Lua, Python, or C/C++.
 User-defined functions are compiled into executable form and the result is embedded into HDF5.
 A supporting library gives access to existing datasets from user code so that data analysis and
 derivation of other data can be produced.
